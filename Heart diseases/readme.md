Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard in PowerBI



The Purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to create Step by Step Dynamic Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard Using PowerBI.

🚀 Here’s What you’ll Learn:

📌 KPI’s Overview : Survival Rate, Avg Age of Survival, Total Survival and Total Death Provide a comprehensive overview of patients.

📌 Survival Count And Average Serum Creatinine by age group Chart : Helps to identify patterns in patient outcomes. Showing how survival rates vary with age & how serum creatinine levels may correlated with those outcomes.

📌 Survival Count and Average Ejection Fraction by Age Group Chart : Visualize the heart function among survivor. We can better understand how heart perform varies with age.

📌 Survival Rate by Age Group Line Chart : Helps us observe how survival rates change with age and identifying age related risk patterns.

📌 Ribbon Chart : Visualize the impact of smoking, high blood pressere, diabetes and anaemia across different age groups. Ribbon sizes represent how these factors contribute to health risks at different ages.

📌 Slicer allows us to filter the data based on Sex.
